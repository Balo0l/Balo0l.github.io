      <li><b>Cybersecurity Configuration Verification:</b>
        <p>Dr. Al-Shaer is recognized as one of the early contributors to the field of cybersecurity configuration verification. He was among the first to apply formal methods, including Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), to analyze and verify the correctness of network security configurations such as firewalls and IPSec policies. His research helped establish a new direction in formal cybersecurity analysis and has been widely cited, earning best paper awards at leading conferences, including IEEE IM (2003) and INFOCOM (2004). [IM03. INFOCOM04, ….] . These formal models were implemented in various tools for discovering configuration errors and policy weakness and hardening security and resiliency of systems. Examples of these tools include ConfigChecker [ICNP09, JSAC09, TDSC16, JSAC05, INFOCOM04, INFOCOM10], SDNChecker [SafeConfig14], CloudChecker [SCC13-1, SCC13-2], ACDChecker, ActiveSDN, IoTChecker [Comp&Sec17], IOTSAT [CNS16] SensorChecker, and WSNPlanner [CNSM12-2] for cyber systems; And AMIAnalyzer [INFOCOM12] and EMSThreatAnalyzer [ICCPS14,] for smart grids and SCADA systems [TSG13, DSN14]. Professor Al-Shaer’s groundbreaking contributions in this domain have transformed cybersecurity configuration management, ensuring automated, scalable, and provably secure network defenses.</p>
