    <h2>Automated Verification & Synthesis of Security Configuration</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <h3>1.1. Configuration Verification</h3>
      <h4>(a) ConfigChecker-- Security configuration analytics for large-scale enterprises</h4>
      <p>[INFOCOM04, JSAC06, ICNP05, ICNP09, SafeConfig10-13, SafeConfig16]: Network systems contain thousands of devices such as routers firewalls, IPSec devices, intrusion detection and prevention systems, wireless access points, virtual machines, and end hosts that comprise millions of configuration parameters (e.g., rules). Although these devices are configured in isolation, their configurations are often interdependent which complicates the enforcement validation of the global security properties in cyber systems. This inherent complexity of cyber configuration significantly increases human errors and makes devices misconfigurations, policy inconsistency, security violations highly likely. It has been widely reported that many security breaches are mainly due to misconfigurations in the network. “It is estimated that configuration errors enable 65% of cyber-attacks and cause 62% of infrastructure downtime”, Network World, July 2006.</p>
      <p>To address these challenges, we developed a novel formal approach that models the global network behavior based on the access control configurations of routers, IPSec, firewalls, NAT, IDS, wireless access points and end-host access controls. We model the semantics of access control policies using Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and then use computation tree logic (CTL) and symbolic model checking to verify network reachability and security requirements. We have implemented our approach in a tool called ConfigChecker that can scale to thousands of devices and millions of configuration rules [ICNP09, Safeconfig12, Safeconfig13]. A novel taxonomy of policy conflicts and misconfiguration for firewalls and IPSec devices with soundness and completeness proof have also been presented [ICNP05, COMMAG06].</p>
